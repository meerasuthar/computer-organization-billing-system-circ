AIM: BILLING SYSTEM
Procedure:
We have created a CIRC file which is used to calculate the total price of items purchased and find the total cost. The price of items are already stored in the Memory and the address signifies the item Id. The Item Id and the number of quantity will be selected by the user. After two clock pulses, we will get the total calculated price, which will be stored in a register and then again if user selects another item Id and quantity, it will give the total sum of previous output and the current amount. Also the total number of products purchased are displayed.
